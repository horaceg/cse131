(* Fill in `myTestList` with your own tests. There are two ways to add a test:
 *
 * (1) By adding the code of the program as a string. In this case, add an entry
 *     of this form in `myTestList`:
 *
 *     t <test_name> <program_code> <result>
 *
 * (2) By adding a test inside the 'input/' folder and adding an entry for it
 *     in `myTestList`. The entry in this case should be:
 *
 *     t_file <test_name> <file_name> <result>
 *     
 *     Where name is the name of the file inside 'input/' with the extension
 *     ".ana". For example:
 *
 *     t_file "myTest" "mytest.ana" "6";
 *)
